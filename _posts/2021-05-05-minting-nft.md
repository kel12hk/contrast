Speaking of `NFT` (Non-fungible token), the first NFT was actually minted and release to th public back to 2014. However, in 2021, this word has no longer be just a buzzword but a trend that everybody is fascinated in. NFT has aroused popularity and holding one of them shows how trendy you are. Besides of holding some NFTs, I would show you below how do I try to mint one of my photos as an NFT and list in the marketplace. I would be more than happy if you wish to buy this 'art piece' from me. lol.

## Steps of how I minted a NFT on my own

### 1. Prepare your artpiece

### 2. Get an account in the NFT marketplace
I am using [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) in my case.

### 3. Connect your wallet with the marketplace. You will need some tokens to mint your NFT on the blockchain you plan to use (Ether, Polygon, Tezos, Flow).
