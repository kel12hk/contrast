Speaking of `NFT` (Non-fungible token), the first NFT was actually minted and release to th public back to 2014. However, in 2021, this word has no longer be just a buzzword but a trend that everybody is fascinated in. NFT has aroused popularity and holding one of them shows how trendy you are. Besides of holding some NFTs, I would show you below how do I try to mint one of my photos as an NFT and list in the marketplace. I would be more than happy if you wish to buy this 'art piece' from me. lol.

## Steps of how I minted a NFT on my own

### 1. Prepare your artpiece

### 2. Get an account in the NFT marketplace
I am using [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) in my case.

### 3. Connect your wallet with the marketplace. You will need some tokens to mint your NFT on the protocol you plan to use (Ether, Polygon, Tezos, Flow).

### 4.

## Table

| Title 1          | Title 2          | Title 3         | Title 4         |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| First entry      | Second entry     | Third entry     | Fourth entry    |
| Fifth entry      | Sixth entry      | Seventh entry   | Eight entry     |
| Ninth entry      | Tenth entry      | Eleventh entry  | Twelfth entry   |
| Thirteenth entry | Fourteenth entry | Fifteenth entry | Sixteenth entry |

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
