## Buying my first NFT 
Many people talk about NFT, but what do people truly see NFT is? In the past, NFT is just a way that people use to proof their ownership of the unique artwork.
So you own the unique artwork and nobody can claim the ownership as it is recorded on the immutable blockchain.

As there are more NFT projects coming in, I see NFT is no longer just an ownership proof of an artwork, it has also extended to be a member of the project community.
Some projects allow their NFT holders in the community to vote for the decision making happening in the community. Some would give perks to the members in the project.  

In some cases, NFT project would grow as a community where every members can express their will freely and the community will grow as the majority of members wishes to.
This is also called Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where the community is ruled by the people rather than a centralized authority.

To experience how does web3 work, I bought my first NFT back in a month ago. Let me share with you how this works:-

The NFT I bought is [Next Trial Run](https://nexttrialrun.io/) and it's created by the Hongkong local Youtubers Trial and Error. 

#### 1. Go to the official page of community
I bought this NFT at the public minting stage. If you'd like to buy a NFT that has already been launched, you may go to the public marketplace like OpenSea, Magic Eden or Alpha Art (depends on your NFT is based on which blockchain).
However, it is always safe to check the available marketplaces from the official NFT community site before your purchase as there are potential spams in the market. DYOR.

#### 2. Prepare some token for the mint/purchase the NFT + gas fee
One of my key takeaways here is to always transfer slightly more tokens to your wallet. 
In the blockchain world, you pay gas fee (aka transaction fee) to process the transactions so you always have to prepare some more tokens to facilitate the transaction for buying your NFT.

This NFT is based on Ether so I have another tips to share - you pick the time where the gas fee is the lowest to perform the transaction. Usually it will be in the Tuesday afternoon (UTC+8), see the [Tracker](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/)

#### 3. Connect wallet, sign the transaction and get your NFT!
Once you have connected your wallet to the NFT site/marketplace, your tokens are ready to transact and obtain the NTR! Next, you authorize the transaction and the NFT will be moved to your wallet! For the NFT that is minted, it is usually in the form of mystery box so you don't know what you are going to get. Of course, it stands a chance to draw a great rarity of your NFT among the NFT collection.

#### 4. Once the transaction is done, you can find your NFT in OpenSea! 
You can locate your NFT under the profile session in OpenSea.
