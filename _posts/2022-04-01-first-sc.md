title: "My first smart contract built on Solidity"
layout: post
---

There are quite a number of DeFi projects are actually supported by smart contracts. Once the conditions in the smart contracts are fulfilled, participants are eligble to retrieve the return. Hence, I have also tried to built one on my own to see how does it work.

The smart contract I built is a rather simple one and I am just to experience how is a smart contact being developed and deployed in a blockchain protocol. 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
