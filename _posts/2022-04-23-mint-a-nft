Many people talk about NFT, but what do people see NFT in the world? In the past, NFT is just a way that people use to proof their ownership of the unique artwork.
So you own the unique artwork and nobody can claim the ownership as it is recorded on the immutable blockchain.

As there are more NFT projects coming in, I see NFT is no longer just an ownership proof of an artwork, it has also extended to be a member of the project community.
Every NFT holder in the community has a say to the way on the decision making happening in the community.
