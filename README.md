## Short introduction

Hi there! This is Kelvin and I am from Hong Kong! I have been in the banking industry for a few years and I hold a strong belief that we can transform the world with technologies in a good way. 

I love to learn new things and here you will learn me more of my background, my works based on what I learnt from the internet!

## Background

I study Information Systems back in university. So I slightly understand some `programming languages` and `cryptography`. (but I am still learning everyday!)

I work in the bank to influence my customers to use digital banking like `API` and `Host-to-host` channels.

I launch banking products and migrate IT systems in the bank too.
