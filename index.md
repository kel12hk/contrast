ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Kelvin and I've been working in `banking` for 5 years (sales, product management, project management & IT development)

ðŸ‘€Â Iâ€™m interested in anything related to blockchain, cryptocurrencies and web3 applications

ðŸŒ±Â Iâ€™m currently learning how institutions use blockchain to transform themselves from TradFi to DeFi

ðŸ“«Â Reach me atÂ kelvinlai@pm.me, let's collaborate and explore!
