ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Kelvin and I've been working in `banking` for 5 years (sales, product management, project management & IT development)

ðŸ‘€Â Iâ€™m interested in anything related to blockchain, cryptocurrencies and web3 applications

ðŸŒ±Â Iâ€™m currently learning how institutions use blockchain to transform themselves from TradFi to DeFi

ðŸ“«Â Reach me atÂ kelvinlai@pm.me, let's collaborate and explore!


## Short introduction

Hi there! This is Kelvin and I am from Hong Kong! I have been in the banking industry for a few years and I hold a strong belief that we can transform the world with technologies in a good way. 

I love to learn new things and here you will learn me more of my background, my works based on what I learnt from the internet!


## Background

I study Information Systems back in university. I also do some easy `programming languages` to build stuff on my own like `Java`, `Python` and `SQL` for my daily handling of business problems.

I work in the bank to influence my customers to switch to digital banking like `API` and `Host-to-host` channels, or simple as mobile app collection or online banking. [One of my notable digital banking deals driven.](https://www.theasset.com/awards/treasury-22-new-economy)

I promote new technologies and data-driven working models in the bank too.
