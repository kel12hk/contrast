# Welcome to Kelvin Lai's page!
## It is for documenting my little developments to share with all of you!

ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Kelvin and I've been working in `banking` for 5 years (sales, product management, project management & IT development)
ðŸ‘€Â Iâ€™m interested in anything related to blockchain, cryptocurrencies and web3 applications
ðŸŒ±Â Iâ€™m currently learning how institutions use blockchain to transform themselves from TradFi to DeFi
ðŸ“«Â Reach me atÂ kelvinlai@pm.me, let's collaborate and explore!
